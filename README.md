# Project-UNFPA-Text-Analytics-Mapping-Citizen-Opinions-to-ODS

This project is a showcase of my competencies in data science, analytics, and problem solving, demonstrating my ability to translate complex challenges into actionable solutions. It was developed as a part of a collaborative effort with UNFPA to automate the classification of citizen opinions into Sustainable Development Goals (ODS 3, 4, and 5), and it highlights the competencies that make me an ideal candidate for a consultant position at Management Solutions.

## Key Competencies Demonstrated

### Technical Expertise and Analytical Skills
- **Advanced Data Preprocessing:**  
  Developed robust pipelines for cleaning, tokenizing, normalizing, and vectorizing text data using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. This includes handling special characters and adapting to various data formats, ensuring a high level of data quality for accurate analysis.

- **Model Development & Evaluation:**  
  Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models including MLP Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. I employed rigorous evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure model robustness and reliability.

- **Efficient Use of Tools & Technologies:**  
  Leveraged Python libraries (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, spaCy) to build scalable solutions. I also utilized data visualization tools to present insights in a clear, actionable manner.

### Problem-Solving & Innovation
- **End-to-End Pipeline Design:**  
  Designed a comprehensive analytical pipeline that automated the entire process—from data ingestion and cleaning to model training and deployment—resulting in significant reductions in manual effort and turnaround time.
  
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:**  
  The project emphasizes the transformation of raw data into strategic insights, enabling quicker and more informed decision making. This experience directly supports consultancy work, where actionable recommendations are critical.

### Communication & Collaboration
- **Effective Team Coordination:**  
  Collaborated in a multidisciplinary team where roles were clearly defined. I took the lead on the technical implementation of the MLP Classifier and contributed to overall project strategy, showcasing my ability to work collaboratively and communicate complex ideas effectively.
  
- **Documentation and Reporting:**  
  Produced comprehensive documentation and reports outlining methodology, challenges, and key findings. This ability to articulate technical details to non-technical stakeholders is essential for successful consultancy.

### Business Acumen
- **Alignment with Organizational Goals:**  
  The project was designed with a clear business objective: to enable UNFPA analysts and decision-makers to process and understand citizen opinions quickly and accurately. My work ensured that the technical solution directly supported the organization's strategic goals.
  
- **Consultative Approach:**  
  I applied a consultative mindset by continuously aligning the technical development with business needs. This involved regular feedback sessions with stakeholders and iterative improvements to meet performance and accuracy benchmarks.

## Project Impact

- **Operational Efficiency:**  
  By automating the classification process, the project reduced analysis time by over 75%, allowing decision-makers to focus on strategic interventions rather than manual data processing.

- **Scalability and Adaptability:**  
  The developed solution is designed to be scalable, accommodating large volumes of data and adapting to evolving data patterns, which is critical for long-term consultancy projects.

- **Actionable Insights:**  
  The analysis provided clear, data-driven insights into public opinions on key issues such as health, education, and gender equality, enabling UNFPA to make informed, timely decisions.

## Conclusion

This project is not only a technical achievement but also a demonstration of my capability to integrate deep analytical skills with strategic business insights. It reflects my readiness to contribute to Management Solutions as a consultant by delivering innovative, data-driven solutions that drive operational excellence and strategic impact.
